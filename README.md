## 🧮 BMI Formula

```
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))²
```

**Example:** Weight = 70 kg, Height = 175 cm  
```
BMI = 70 / (1.75)² = 70 / 3.0625 ≈ 22.86  →  Normal Weight ✅
```

## 👥 Age-Group Logic

BMI thresholds are **not one-size-fits-all**. This calculator adjusts them based on your age:

### 🧒 Children & Teens (Age 2–17)
BMI is calculated the same way but interpreted using **BMI-for-age percentile** approximations (as per CDC growth guidelines). Simplified thresholds are used since full percentile tables require sex-specific growth chart data.

| Category | Approx. BMI |
|---|---|
| Underweight | < 14 |
| Healthy Weight | 14 – 21 |
| Overweight | 21 – 25.9 |
| Obese | ≥ 26 |

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer shown:** For children, a paediatrician should assess BMI against age/sex-specific percentile charts.

---

### 🧑 Adults (Age 18–64)
Standard **WHO / NIH** adult BMI categories:

| Category | BMI Range | Colour |
|---|---|---|
| Underweight | < 18.5 | 🔵 Blue |
| Normal Weight | 18.5 – 24.9 | 🟢 Green |
| Overweight | 25 – 29.9 | 🟠 Orange |
| Obese | ≥ 30 | 🔴 Red |

---

### 🧓 Seniors (Age 65+)
Research from multiple geriatric health organisations suggests a **slightly higher BMI (22–27)** is associated with better health outcomes in older adults.

| Category | BMI Range |
|---|---|
| Underweight | < 22 |
| Healthy Weight | 22 – 27 |
| Overweight | 27 – 31.9 |
| Obese | ≥ 32 |

> ℹ️ A note is displayed to explain the adjusted thresholds.

## 🎯 Healthy Weight Range Calculation

The displayed healthy weight range is computed from the **age-group's healthy BMI bounds** and the user's height:

```
Min Healthy Weight = bmiLow  × (height in m)²
Max Healthy Weight = bmiHigh × (height in m)²
```

**Gain / Loss suggestion** is the difference between the current weight and the nearest healthy boundary.

## ✅ Input Validation Rules

| Field | Rules |
|---|---|
| **Weight** | Required · Must be > 0 · Max 500 kg |
| **Height** | Required · Must be > 0 · Max 300 cm |
| **Age** | Required · Integer · Min 2 · Max 120 |

Errors appear on field blur and clear as soon as the user starts typing again. All three fields also respond to the **Enter** key to submit.
